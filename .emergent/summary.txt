<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a full-stack landing page for a voice AI product called Gretta AI. The development process was highly iterative, with the following key feature requests implemented sequentially:
1.  Build a modern, conversion-optimized landing page with a blue-purple gradient theme.
2.  Implement full-stack functionality for lead capture forms (contact and free trial).
3.  Add the company logo.
4.  Change the website's theme to a light mode with a white background and colors matching a new logo provided by the user.
5.  Create an admin dashboard to view form submissions.
6.  Add a Book an Appointment feature with a lead capture modal form.
7.  Change the logo in the header and adjust the layout for a more professional look.
8.  Adjust header spacing and update pricing plans (changing 14-day trial to 7-day trial and modifying plan details).
9.  Create a webhook endpoint for Zapier/Hubspot integration and redirect users to a Calendly link after form submission.
10. Optimize the hero section layout to ensure all key text is visible without scrolling.
11. Add an interactive ROI calculator.
12. Update the pricing section to a 4-tier model with new plan names, prices, and features.
13. Implement a Push-to-Speak feature for real-time voice conversations using the Retell AI service, including integrating the user's API key and agent ID.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A complete and functional full-stack application. The frontend is a React-based landing page for Gretta AI featuring multiple sections: a Hero section with a live Push-to-Speak voice agent, Features, a 4-tier Pricing section, an ROI Calculator, a Demo section, a Trust section, and a Footer. The page includes modals for booking appointments and signing up for free trials. There is also an  page to display captured leads.

The backend is built with FastAPI and connects to a MongoDB database. It provides endpoints for capturing leads from the contact, trial, and booking forms, an endpoint to serve analytics for the admin dashboard, a webhook endpoint to export leads, and an endpoint to generate access tokens for the Retell AI integration.

**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: The final task was the full implementation of the Push-to-Speak feature using the user-provided Retell AI agent ID and API key. This involved creating a backend endpoint to generate an access token and integrating the Retell client SDK into a new  frontend component. The agent resolved multiple bugs during this process, including an invalid  file format, incorrect Retell SDK usage on the backend, and JSX parsing errors on the frontend.
-   Status: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
-   Agent Testing Done: Y
-   Which testing method agent to use? Manual testing by user to verify the voice agent interaction. The agent has already verified the technical integration.
-   User Testing Done: N
